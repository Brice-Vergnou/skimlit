# Skimlit

## Context

This project was a Milestone Project from the "Zero to Mastery Tensorflow" course. The idea was the following : sometimes it is really hard to read abstracts in research papers because they are heavy and dense. To avoid that, we built Skimlit, a deep learning model able to separate each sentence in a specific group (context,methods,conclusion...).
