# Skimlit

## Context

This project was a Milestone Project from the "Zero to Mastery Tensorflow" course. The idea was the following : sometimes it is really hard to read abstracts in research papers because they are heavy and dense. To avoid that, we built Skimlit, a deep learning model able to separate each sentence in a specific group (context,methods,conclusion...).

## Methods

Different methods have been used from the baseline (Naive Bayes) to the final model (A triple model that handles token, character, and positional embedding) to see what works or not, to reach 82% accuracy
