# Skimlit

## Context

This project was a Milestone Project from the "Zero to Mastery Tensorflow" course. The idea was the following : sometimes it is really hard to read abstracts in research papers because they are heavy and dense. To avoid that, we built Skimlit, a deep learning model able to separate each sentence in a specific group (context,methods,conclusion...).

## Methods

Different methods have been used from the baseline (Naive Bayes) to the final model (A triple model that handles token, character, and positional embedding) to see what works or not, to reach 82% accuracy

## Objective

The original objective was to create a web extension to, from a simple right click, add headers depending on the results to make the text skimmable. Unfortunately, time is lacking and I didn't want to spend so much time on this project. So if you ever want to help, you're free to :)
